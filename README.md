# Solana Program Library Anchor IDLs
Anchor IDLs for the Solana Program Library

This repository is split into two main folders:

The dummy-programs folder contains a dummy Anchor implementation in Rust code for the respective Solana program. These programs were simply used to generate the IDLs.

The IDLs folder contains the resulting IDL JSON files that were produced from building the programs in the dummy-programs folder.
